# cloud-resume-challenge AWS Edition

The Cloud Resume Challenge, by Forrest Brazeal, is a self-guided project for DevOps and Cloud Developers. Your website, hosted on AWS, uses various services like S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Certificate Manager, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Boto3. Infrastructure-as-Code is managed with Terraform, and GitHub Actions handles two CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient updates and deployments.

## Objective:
Create a cloud-based resume using Amazon Web Services (AWS) services to demonstrate your skills and expertise in cloud computing.

## Challenge Overview:
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a fun and educational project designed to showcase your proficiency with AWS services and help you build a real-world application - your own resume!

## Tasks:
## 1. Register a Domain:
Purchase a domain name from a domain registrar of your choice (e.g., AWS Route 53, GoDaddy, Namecheap). This will be the domain for your resume website.

## 2. Set up a Static Website:
Host your resume as a static website on AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service). You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your resume. Make sure your S3 bucket is configured for static website hosting.

## 3. Create a CDN:
Set up an AWS CloudFront distribution to deliver your resume with low latency and high availability.

## 4. Build an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Pipeline:
Use AWS CloudFormation to create a CI/CD pipeline. Automate the deployment of your resume updates.

## 5. Implement HTTPS:
Secure your website using AWS ACM (Certificate Manager) to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate and configure your CloudFront distribution to use HTTPS.

## 6. Resume Content:
Populate your resume with your professional details, including your skills, work experience, and education.

## 7. Custom Domain Configuration:
Configure your custom domain (from step 1) to point to your CloudFront distribution.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging:
Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor your application's performance and create CloudWatch Logs for debugging purposes.

## 9. Documentation:
Provide clear and concise documentation on how your Cloud Resume is structured and how to update it.

## 10. Bonus Challenges (Optional):
Implement serverless components using AWS Lambda for dynamic content (e.g., fetching blog posts from a database).
Secure your application using AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).
Implement a contact form using AWS services (e.g., Amazon SES for email notifications).
Optimize the performance of your website with AWS services like Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration and AWS Lambda@Edge.
Submission:
Once you have completed the Cloud Resume Challenge, share your resume website URL and the link to your GitHub repository containing the code and infrastructure as code templates.

## Prerequisites:
An AWS account.
Basic understanding of AWS services (e.g., S3, CloudFront, CloudFormation).
Familiarity with web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Domain name purchased from a domain registrar.
