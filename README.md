# cloud-resume-challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge, by Forrest Brazeal, is a self-guided project for DevOps and Cloud Developers. Your website, hosted on AWS, uses various services like S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Certificate Manager, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Boto3. Infrastructure-as-Code is managed with Terraform, and GitHub Actions handles two CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient updates and deployments.
